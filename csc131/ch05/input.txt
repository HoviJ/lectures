Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb.
Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow.

And every where that Mary went, Mary went, Mary went.
Every where that Mary went, her lamb was sure to go.

He followed her to school one day, school one day, school one day.
He followed her to school one day and ended up being lunch for everyone.
