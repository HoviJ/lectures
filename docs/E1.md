# Exam 1

This exam covers the material found in chapters 5-8 of our Python First Programs text. The exam consists of five (5) equally-weighted questions (2 points each). Please write directly on this exam in the space provided. Note: ample space is provided; the amount of space provided is not indicative of the size of your response (in some cases, the answer could be a single line of code). Be verbose – the more insight I have into your thought process, the more potential partial credit can be given (assuming, of course, it’s along the right track).

This exam is an individual effort. You are not allowed to use your book or a computer, or advice from your peers. You are allowed a single “cheat sheet.”

Please print (legibly) your name below that serves both as an identifier and as signifying your understanding of the rules and regulations surrounding this exam. Anyone caught violating these rules on the exam will receive a 0 and the incident will be documented and reported to the chair of the Computer Science department.

## Name:

1. Write a function that inputs a text file and returns the number of unique words that are longer than 5 characters. The name of the function is `big_unique_words`. This function has one string parameter named `input_file_name`, and as indicated, returns an integer (the number of unique words that are longer than 5 characters). If your code relies on any module, be sure to add the import statement needed to gain access to that module
1. Write a program that computes and returns the sum of the numbers in a text file. You should make use of two higher-order functions to simplify the design. The name of this function is `sum_data_in_file` and it takes one string argument name `input_file_name`. You may assume that the data in the file are all integers, so the return type of this function is an integer. If your code relies on any module, be sure to add the import statement needed to gain access to that module.
1. Using the `filter` function and a `lambda` argument, write an expression that produces a `list` of the values in some list named `data` that are larger than 3.
1. Write a function that uses the Turtle graphics system to draw the following figure below. The name of the function shall be `draw_robot_head` and it takes two arguments, the first being an instance of `Turtle` named `turtle` and the second being `length` of the encapsulating rectangle. Given that length, the height of the encapsulating rectangle is ¼ the given length. The length of the "ear" is 1/8th the given length and the height of the "ear" is ½ the height of the encapsulating rectangle. The bottom left-hand corner of the encapsulating rectangle of the robot's head is the origin (0, 0).

1. Draw the GUI that the following code would generate. In your drawing, identify each GUI component by name.
    ```python
    class TemperatureConverter(EasyFrame):
    """A termperature conversion program."""

        def __init__(self):
            """Sets up the window and widgets."""
            EasyFrame.__init__(self, title = "Temperature Converter")

            # Label and field for Celsius
            self.addLabel(text = "Celsius",
                          row = 0, column = 0)
            self.celsiusField = self.addFloatField(value = 0.0,
                                                   row = 1,
                                                   column = 0,
                                                   precision = 2)

            # Label and field for Fahrenheit
            self.addLabel(text = "Fahrenheit",
                      row = 0, column = 1)
            self.fahrField = self.addFloatField(value = 32.0,
                                                row = 1,
                                                column = 1,
                                                precision = 2)

            # Celsius to Fahrenheit button
            self.addButton(text = ">>>>",
                           row = 2, column = 0,
                           command = self.computeFahr)

            # Fahrenheit to Celsius button
            self.addButton(text = "<<<<",
                           row = 2, column = 1,
                           command = self.computeCelsius)
    ```
