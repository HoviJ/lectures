## Exam 1 Study Guide

### Overview

Exam 1 characteristics are presented below. Exam 1

* covers the material found in Chapters 5-8,
* consists of 5 short-answer questions:
    * one question from chapter 5
    * two questions from chapter 6
    * one question from chapter 7
    * one question from chapter 8
* weighs each question the same: 2 points each for a total of 10 points
* must be completed individually; no collaboration allowed
* must be completed without the use computers, books or notes
* must be completed during the normally scheduled class time (12:20-1:10)

Recommendations

* Use a pencil (and bring a good eraser in case you need to correct mistakes)
* Pace yourself; look at all the questions first and tackle the ones that are obvious (or easy)... you have 50 minutes and 5 questions, so try to average 10 minutes per question
* Get a good night sleep and relax

### Study Guide

To help prepare for this exam I suggest

* looking at your lab solutions and homework solutions (as well as my feedback on them)
* looking at Projects 
    * 6 and 7 at the end of Chapter 5
    * 5, 9 at the end of Chapter 6
    * 1 at the end of Chapter 7
* knowing how to construct a GUI in the `__init__(self)` method from an image of a GUI

#### Chapter 5 - Lists and Dictionaries

Problem 6: Define a function `decimal_to_rep` that returns the representation of an integer in a given base. The two arguments should be the integer and the base. The function should return a string. It should use a lookup table that associates integers with digits. Include a main function that tests the conversion function with numbers in several bases.

Problem 7: Write a program that inputs a text file. The program should print the unique words in the file in alphabetical order.

#### Chapter 6 - Design with Functions

Problem 6: A list is sorted in ascending order if it is empty or each item except the last one is less than or equal to its successor. Define a predicate `is_sorted` that expects a list as an argument and returns `True` if the list is sorted, or returns `False` otherwise.

Problem 9: Write a program that computes and prints the average of the numbers in a text file. You should make use of two higher-order functions to simplify the design.

#### Chapter 7

Problem 1: Define a function `draw_circle`. This function should expect a `Turtle` object, the coordinates of the circle's center point, and the circle's radius as arguments. The function should draw the specified circle. The algorithm should draw the circle's circumference by turning 3 degrees and moving a given distance 120 times. Calculate the distance moved with the formula 2.0 * PI * radius / 120.0.

#### Chapter 8 

Again, I'll give you a picture of a GUI and you should be prepared to realize that gui in the `__init__(self)` method of an `EasyFrame` class.
